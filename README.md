# Raymond

Play with Raymond at [raymond.maxledlie.com](raymond.maxledlie.com).

Raymond is a 2D optics simulator. I am building it to help me understand and explain concepts in [ray tracing](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_tracing_(graphics)>).

To run Raymond locally, clone this site and run `npm run dev`.

Raymond uses React for rendering UI and the HTML canvas for rendering the world.
