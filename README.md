# Raymond

Play with Raymond at [raymond.maxledlie.com](raymond.maxledlie.com).

Raymond is a 2D optics simulator. I am building it to help me understand and explain concepts in [ray tracing](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_tracing_(graphics)>).

To run Raymond locally, clone this repo and run `npm run build` followed by `npm start`, then visit `localhost:8000`.

Raymond is a static site, written in TypeScript. It uses the HTML canvas API for draw calls and currently has zero dependencies.
